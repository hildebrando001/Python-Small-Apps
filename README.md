# General information over each small app

## Chat room
I desired to develope this small app to have something implemented using threads and WebSockets.

## How to run each one of the small app here
```bash
* CHAT ROOM - Copy the respective folder on the repository.                                        
    git clone https://github.com/hildebrando001/Python-Small-Apps

* Run the file server.py on the terminal or command prompt
    python3 server.py

* Run the client.py in at least 2 different terminal or command prompt, to communicate with each other 
    python3 client.py

```
